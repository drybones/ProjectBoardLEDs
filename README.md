ProjectBoardLEDs
================

Prototype code for controlling LED status lights for a project whiteboard. Uses OPC over web sockets to talk to a FadeCandy controller, which in turn drives strips of RGB LEDs. Each project status can be represented by a static or animating region of the LED strip.
